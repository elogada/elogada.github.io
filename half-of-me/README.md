**Half of me**


Half of my legs is scars

From falling over and getting scratches

Half of my shoulders is bruises

From bumping into walls

Half of my stomach is bloatation

nation because I drank milk this morning

Half of my foot is dirt

Because I don't wear slippers in the evening

Half of my eyes can't see

I'm basically blind, you see

Half of my hair is white

Because that ageing is starting to bite

But despite all of this, half of me is you

You'll always be part of my life

And without you I am incomplete

I know someday, you'll become my wife
