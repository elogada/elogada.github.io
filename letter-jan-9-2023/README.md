**Hi, Linette. My baby girl. My only one.**

It's been a year since we committed. I didn't love you out of a need for emotional fulfillment, or out of a necessity, or out of the desire to evade sadness. I loved, and continue to love you, because you, and you alone, deserve all of me.


I grew up thinking I already knew everything I needed. When I met you, the only woman who truly deserves all of my time, effort, attention, and affection, I realized how much I lacked.


In retrospect, I now realize I had been a mess before I met you. You taught me how to be more patient. You taught me to listen first before everything. You taught me that true love comes with no conditions.


I still do continually learn thanks to you. I am slowly learning to take control of my anger. From you, I've learned how to be more patient with colleagues. You've also taught me how to be more appreciative of others. And on top of this, you've made me realize that self-improvement is a lifelong process.


When I thought I had everything, you gave me more. ðŸ™‚


Babe, you are perfect, simply, simply perfect. As your boyfriend, partner, and future husband, I want you to know that I will strive to be perfect to you, too. From the lovely cuddles, to the memories in scenic places, to the laughter and the banter, you have everything I want in the lady I see myself spending my entire life with.


For you, and for us, and for our future. I will always choose to love you. â™¥
