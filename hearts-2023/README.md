**Your Name is My Favorite**

There are many names in my head
There is a Big Bird Ling Long
There is a Foodification Ferrer
There is a Visenya Chiroo
And there is Dinnerification Bueser

There are many funny names in my head
Like Mang Jose Jefferson
There is Boyet Obama
There is Enteng Armstrong
And finally we have Paeng Ford

There are some weird names in my head
Like Jeffawesome Walawalabingbong
Atalantum, apparently Atalanta with a dick
And Percival Bryan, the stereotypical Bryan
Like Patroclus and Achilles. they were roommates

But my favorite name is Linette Grace G. Saguban
And if I were to hear one name forever
I want it to be Linette Grace G. Saguban
Better yet Linette Elogada, one day
