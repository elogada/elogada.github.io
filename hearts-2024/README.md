**You Make Me Sleepy: A Poem**


I was born alert

Eyes open, always ready

I live everyday

On edge and prepared

I sit still most times

And yet still I run

In place, never moving

I am always awake

But you, when nearby

Permission to rest, I gain

I am safe, I am sound

You are my safe space

I, yours, you, mine

You are my safe place
